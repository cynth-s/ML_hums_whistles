# Machine Learning mini-project submission

The mini-project consists of two components:


1.   **Basic solution** [6 marks]: Using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input a Potter or a StarWars audio segment and predicts its song label (either Harry or StarWars).
2.   **Advanced solution** [10 marks]: There are two options. (i) Formulate a machine learning problem that can be attempted using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset and build a solution model. (ii) Create a product that uses the functionality provided by a model trained on the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset (e.g. a simple App that predicts the label Harry or StarWars when you hum to it).  

The submission will consist of two Jupyter notebooks, one for the basic solution and another one for advanced solution. Please **name each notebook**:

* ECS7020P_miniproject_basic.ipynb
* ECS7020P_miniproject_advanced.ipynb

then **zipped and submitted toghether**.

Each uploaded notebook should consist of: 

*   **Text cells**, describing concisely each step and results.
*   **Code cells**, implementing each step.
*   **Output cells**, i.e. the output from each code cell.

and **should have the structure** indicated below. Notebooks will not be run, please make sure that the output cells are saved.

How will we evaluate your submission?

*   Conciseness in your writing (10%).
*   Correctness in your methodology (30%).
*   Correctness in your analysis and conclusions (30%).
*   Completeness (10%).
*   Originality (10%).
*   Efforts to try something new (10%).

Suggestion: Why don't you use **GitHub** to manage your project? GitHub can be used as a presentation card that showcases what you have done and gives evidence of your data science skills, knowledge and experience. 

Each notebook should be structured into the following 9 sections:

# 1 Author

**Student Name**:  
**Student ID**:  


# 2 Problem formulation

Describe the machine learning problem that you want to solve and explain what's interesting about it.
# 3 Machine Learning pipeline

Describe your ML pipeline. Clearly identify its input and output, any intermediate stages (for instance, transformation -> models), and intermediate data moving from one stage to the next. Note that your pipeline does not need to include all the stages. 
# 4 Transformation stage

Describe any transformations, such as feature extraction. Identify input and output.
# 5 Modelling

Describe the ML models that you will implement. 
# 6 Methodology

Describe how you will train and validate your models, how model performance is assesssed (i.e. accuracy, confusion matrix, etc)
# 7 Dataset

Describe the dataset that you will use to create your models and validate them. If you need to preprocess it, do it here. Include visualisations too. You can visualise raw data samples or extracted features.
# 8 Results

Carry out your experiments here, explain your results.
# 9 Conclusions

Your conclusions, improvements, etc should go here
